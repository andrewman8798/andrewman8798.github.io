      <h1>Hi there! Welcome to the world of Andrew Ta!</h1>
  		<p>Hi, my name is Andrew Ta and I am a senior attending the California State University, Fullerton. This is one of the last classes I need to graduate, so I hope I can learn something that could be useful for future career! My interests start in web development as creating websites may be a interesting career choice. In my spare time, my hobbies include playing basketball, swimming, singing (even though I'm not that good at it), and hanging out with friends.</p>
